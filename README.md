# Rep-Review: Fine-Grained Sentiment Analysis for Gym Customer Feedback
Analyzing customer feedback is essential for businesses to understand preferences, improve services, and enhance customer satisfaction. 
Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) enables a more precise evaluation by identifying specific aspects in reviews and determining the sentiment associated with each. This project leverages NLP techniques to automatically extract aspects and classify their sentiments, providing detailed insights from unstructured gym-related reviews. 
While focused on gym feedback, the approach is adaptable to any domain with customer reviews, empowering businesses to refine services, enhance marketing strategies, and optimize customer experiences.
